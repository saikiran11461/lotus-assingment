# Lotus Assignment

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and an Express backend. It utilizes various technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It handles the user interface and interactions.

1. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    The frontend will be served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and any lint errors will be shown in the console.

### Backend

The backend is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT. It provides the API and handles server-side logic.

1. **Navigate to the server directory**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be running on [http://localhost:2345](http://localhost:2345).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT
- **State Management**: Redux (for the frontend)

## Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

- **`npm run start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- **`npm run eject`**: Removes the single build dependency and gives full control over configuration files.
